#### Advantage of Using keras : It's a high level api of tensorflow so to implement linear or logistic regression takes code of a line or two
## Highly helpful for Neural Network since it's libraries are written  in a very optimised way to implement it
#### Disadvantage :
## Can't implement Linear regression using normal equation because there is no method to multiply matrices or form matrices
## If we have to implement anything from scratch it has to be done with some low level libraries and built it from scratch.
