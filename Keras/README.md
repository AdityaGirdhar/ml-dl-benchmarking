# Advantage 
### It's a high level api of tensorflow 
### It has many inbuilt function to implement the main algorithm which in implementing takes a line or two
### Highly helpful for Neural Network since it's libraries are written  in a very optimised way to implement it
# Disadvantage :
### Can't implement Linear regression using normal equation because there is no method to multiply 
### Can't implement anything from scratch because there is no way to make matrices or perform operation on them from scratch
### To implement anything from scratch it has to be done with some low level libraries and built it from scratch.
